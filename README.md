# FoodRescue
My Final Year application in the National College of Ireland.

Food Rescue is an application that allows businesses to sell products for cheaper that will eventually go to waste. 
The purpose of this is to help the environment firstly, but to give the added benefit of saving the business and user's money. 

Features Include:

A product pricing scheme that goes down in price depending on the time e.g If a product is put up at 4 and is over by 6, this product will go down in price till 6. 

An interactive map that users can scroll around and can see the various businesses around them.

An order page for users and a business

Ability to sort businesses based on their category

Change your profile

Create, update and delete products
