# FoodRescue
# My Final Year application in the National College of Ireland.

Food Rescue is an application that allows businesses to sell products for cheaper that will eventually go to waste. 

The purpose of this is to help the environment firstly, but to give the added benefit of saving the business and user's money. 

# How to run the application:

Download Expo Go on your mobile device

Download Expo using NPM - npm install --global expo-cli

Pull the master branch into VS code or a similar code editor

Create a new file called config.js and copy the api key variable - This is in the txt file 

Write expo start in your terminal

Scan the QR code on your screen on the Expo Go app
